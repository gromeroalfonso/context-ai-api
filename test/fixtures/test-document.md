# Test Document for Context.ai

This is a test document used for integration and end-to-end testing of the Context.ai Knowledge Context module.

## Introduction

This document contains structured content that will be parsed, chunked, and embedded by the system. The purpose is to verify that the complete document ingestion pipeline works correctly from HTTP request to database storage.

## Main Content

### Section 1: Technology Stack

Context.ai uses modern technologies including:
- **NestJS** for the backend framework
- **PostgreSQL** with **pgvector** extension for vector storage
- **TypeORM** for database operations
- **Google Gemini** for AI embeddings and generation
- **Docker** for containerization

### Section 2: Architecture

The system follows Clean Architecture principles with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Domain Layer**: Business entities and rules
2. **Application Layer**: Use cases and workflows
3. **Infrastructure Layer**: External services and persistence
4. **Presentation Layer**: HTTP controllers and DTOs

### Section 3: Features

The Knowledge Context module provides:
- Document parsing (PDF, Markdown, plain text)
- Intelligent chunking with sliding window algorithm
- Vector embeddings for semantic search
- Efficient storage with PostgreSQL + pgvector
- RESTful API with Swagger documentation

## Conclusion

This test document demonstrates the system's ability to process and understand structured content. The chunking algorithm should split this into multiple fragments while preserving context through overlapping windows.

## Additional Notes

- Test documents should be representative of real-world content
- The system should handle various document formats gracefully
- Error handling and validation are critical for production use
- Performance optimization is important for scalability

### Final Thoughts

Thank you for using Context.ai for your knowledge management needs. This test document helps ensure the system works reliably and efficiently.
